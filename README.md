Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates personalized financial plans, including retirement, investment, insurance, and savings solutions. They needed to modernize their web application and improve security to protect client financial data. Specifically, they wanted a file verification process and secure communications implemented to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. I successfully identified software security vulnerabilities and implemented solutions by adding encryption, secure communication, and checksum verification. Writing secure code is important because it protects sensitive financial data and ensures client trust. Secure software also safeguards a company’s reputation and reduces the risk of costly data breaches. One of the more challenging aspects was analyzing the dependency-check report and determining which vulnerabilities were false positives. Using suppression rules and refactoring code to improve security gave me a deeper understanding of how vulnerabilities are detected and mitigated.

To strengthen the security of Artemis Financial’s application, I implemented several layers of protection to safeguard sensitive client data. This included deploying AES encryption to ensure secure data handling, configuring a self signed SSL/TLS certificate to enable secure HTTPS communication, and adding a checksum verification feature to confirm the integrity of transferred files. These enhancements reduced the risk of unauthorized access and data tampering while ensuring that communication between the client and server remained encrypted and protected. In future projects, I would continue using tools like the OWASP Dependency Check to identify potential security risks and verify the safety of third party libraries. I would also rely on secure coding best practices and up to date encryption standards to evaluate vulnerabilities and determine the most effective mitigation techniques. Combined with automated static analysis with manual code reviews will allow for comprehensive security testing and ensure that vulnerabilities are identified early in the development process.

After refactoring the code I conducted thorough testing to ensure both functionality and security. I verified that HTTPS was configured and functioning correctly, tested the checksum process to confirm accurate data validation, and reviewed the dependency check reports to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. These steps confirmed that the application remained stable and secure after implementing the required changes. Throughout this project I used several tools and practices that will benefit future assignments and professional tasks. These included the OWASP Dependency Check for vulnerability detection, Java Keytool for certificate generation, and secure coding standards such as avoiding hard coded credentials and using SHA-256 for hashing. These practices demonstrate my ability to refactor code securely, manage encryption, and mitigate security risks effectively.
